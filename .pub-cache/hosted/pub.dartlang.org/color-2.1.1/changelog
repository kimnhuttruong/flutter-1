2.0.0
-----
* Color and all subclasses now implement a const constructor.
* Colors are no longer mutable, and all conversion and filter methods return new Color objects.
* Removed the Color.clone() method (this was only generally useful when Colors were mutable).
* Adjusted the greyscale and invert ColorFilters to use the CIELAB color space, giving better results.
* Added a lighten and darken ColorFilter.
* Added an RgbColor.name() constructor to create colors by CSS3 name.
* Added a Color.toHexColor() method for easier conversion to the HexColor class.
* Added a CssColorSpace interface for the color spaces which have representation in the CSS standard (RGB, HEX, and HSL).
